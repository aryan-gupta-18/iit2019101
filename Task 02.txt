FOSS
I think this would be really helpfull for improving my technical skills.
Also chosing an open source organization and making contibutions in it under 
mentorship would make me learn many new things.

APP DEVELOPMENT
Idea of creating applications sounds quite inviting.
Everyone nowadays uses apps and creating one would teach many things .
